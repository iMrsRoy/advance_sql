first name,
and last name of all employees with a number higher than 109990.Create a fourth column in the query,
indicating whether this employee is also a manager,
according to the data provided in the dept_manager table,
or a regular employee.
SELECT e.emp_no,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    CASE
        WHEN dm.emp_no IS NOT NULL THEN 'Manager'
        ELSE 'Employee'
    END AS is_manager
FROM employees e
    LEFT JOIN dept_manager dm ON dm.emp_no = e.emp_no
WHERE e.emp_no > 109990;
