Similar to the exercises done in the lecture,
obtain a resultset containing the employee number,
first name,
and last name of all employees with a number higher than 109990.Create a fourth column in the query,
indicating whether this employee is also a manager,
according to the data provided in the dept_manager table,
or a regular employee.
SELECT e.emp_no,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    CASE
        WHEN dm.emp_no IS NOT NULL THEN 'Manager'
        ELSE 'Employee'
    END AS is_manager
FROM employees e
    LEFT JOIN dept_manager dm ON dm.emp_no = e.emp_no
WHERE e.emp_no > 109990;


THE SQL CASE
    Statement - Exercise 3 Extract 
    the employee number,first name, and last name of the first 
    10 employees,and add a fourth column, called “ current_employee 
    ” saying recently hire or long timer in the company, 5th column
    will use IF statement to say full form on the gender.

SELECT first_name, last_name,
CASE
when hire_date > SYSDATE() then 'New Workers'
else 'Experience Workers' 
end as current_employee,
if (gender = 'F', 'Female', 'Male')
from employees e limit 10;

Exercise #2:

Write a query that upon execution, assigns a sequential number for each employee number registered in the "employees" table. Partition the data by the employee's first name and order it by their last name in ascending order (for each partition).
SELECT emp_no, first_name,last_name,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY first_name ORDER BY last_name) AS row_num
FROM employees;
